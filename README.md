## Programming, Random References from the past, for the future :sunrise:.

This is a compilation of articles, notes, documentation, training resources, and more found all around Reddit, GitHub, etc...

Also, as a way to keep track of consumed courses or classes.

Note: _I was tired of using browser bookmarks and Reddit's 'saved' feature. I just wanted that info centralized and quick to access._
